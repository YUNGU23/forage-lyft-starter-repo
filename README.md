# Lyft Back-End Engineering Project

## Introduction
This repository is a personal reflection of my journey through back-end engineering. It encapsulates the challenges I faced, the solutions I devised, and the knowledge I gained in the realm of software development at Lyft.

## My Contributions
Throughout this project, I have:
- Designed **clean software architectures** for complex systems, focusing on modularity and scalability.
- Applied **refactoring techniques** to enhance code maintainability and readability.
- Written **unit tests** to validate the functionality of individual components.
- Practiced **test-driven development (TDD)** to ensure robust feature implementation from the outset.

## What I Learned
The key takeaways from my experience include:
- **Python**: Deepened my understanding of Python for back-end development, emphasizing clean coding practices.
- **Refactoring**: Learned the art of restructuring existing codebases without altering their external behavior.
- **Software Architecture**: Gained insights into the principles of creating resilient and adaptable software systems.
- **TDD**: Adopted a disciplined approach to software development that starts with specifying requirements through tests.
- **UML**: Enhanced my ability to use Unified Modeling Language to visualize system designs effectively.
- **Unit Testing**: Developed a thorough approach to testing, ensuring each part of the code is reliable and functions as intended.

## Reflections
This project has been a testament to my growth as a software engineer. It has pushed me to think critically about design patterns, embrace the iterative process of development, and uphold the highest standards of code quality.

## Exploring the Project
I invite you to delve into this repository to see the fruits of my labor. Each directory contains detailed explanations of the concepts applied and the reasoning behind my code choices.

## Acknowledgments
I extend my gratitude to the Lyft Engineering Team for providing a platform to hone my skills, and to all the contributors and reviewers who have enriched this learning experience.
